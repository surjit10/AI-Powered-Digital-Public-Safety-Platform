# GitHub Workflow Guide

## Rules

- Never work on `main`.
- Never work on `develop`.
- Every task should be done in a separate branch.
- One task = One commit.
- One task = One Pull Request.
- Always merge into `develop`.
- Only Diganta will merge `develop` into `main`.
- Use **Squash Merge**.
- Ask one teammate to review before merging.

---

## Starting a New Task

Update your local repository

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

Create your task branch (example for Citizen/Bank UIs or BFFs)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/Surjit-citizen-ui
# OR
git checkout -b feature/Surjit-citizen-bff
```

Work on your task.

## Finishing a Task

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): complete T4 authentication service"
git push -u origin feature/Surjit-auth
```

Go to GitHub

Open a Pull Request

```

        ↓

```

Ask one teammate to review.

After approval,

Click **Squash Merge**.
